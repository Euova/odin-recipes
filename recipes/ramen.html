    <h2>Description:</h2>


    <p>This Japanese noodle dish combines a flavorful broth, a choice of noodles, and a range of meats or vegetables.</p>
    <p>Since the broth is clear and the noodles are often thin curly noodles, the flavor is typically salty and light.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>


    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups of chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 packages of instant ramen</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps:</h2>


    <ol>
        <li>In a sizable saucepan, add the eggs and 1 inch of cold water. 1 minute of boiling and cooking is required. Remove eggs from the heat and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Leave eggs alone for 8 to 10 minutes. Before peeling and halving, thoroughly drain and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Over medium heat, warm the olive oil in a sizable Dutch oven or stockpot. Add the ginger and garlic, and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring often, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in 3 cups of water, soy sauce, and chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes or so. For two to three minutes, stir in the ramen packages until they are loose and well cooked.</li>
        <li>The green onions should be stirred for around 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>With eggs as a garnish, serve right away.</li>
    </ol>
